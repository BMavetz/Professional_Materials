# Professional Materials

This webpage serves as a professional portfolio.  It details an About Me section, a Projects section, and a Contact section.  The page is made for both mobile and desktop screen sizes, with a responsive design that adjusts based on the screen size.  

The Projects section showcases 5 of my deployed webpages, showcasing two team projects, and three applications that were developed by myself.  The team projects are the most advanced applications, and demonstrate the ability to successfully communicate as a group of individuals to create a functional web application.  The following are the team-based applications: Food Pantry locator, and Sporting Event Finderers.  Each webpage shown has links for the associated live link, as well as the github repository section.

The Contact section has contact information including phone, and email, as well as links to my github profile, LinkedIn profile, and a PDF of my resume.

# Professional Materials

This webpage serves as a professional portfolio.  It details an About Me section, a Projects section, and a Contact section.  The page is made for both mobile and desktop screen sizes, with a responsive design that adjusts based on the screen size.  

The Projects section showcases 5 of my deployed webpages, showcasing a Sporting Event Finder page that was created through a team of 4 developers, including myself, and is the most in depth application.  Each webpage shown has links for the associated live link, as well as the github repository section.

The Contact section has phone, email, and links to my github profile, LinkedIn profile, and a PDF resume.  

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but it's also *critical* on your journey as a developer.
